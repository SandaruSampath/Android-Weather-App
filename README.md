This is the weather app created by me using android studio and java language. I  created the User Interface (UI) using Andriod studio to enter the relevant fields.They i have done the coding part in java language . i have done all the validations too. so the user have not entered required data fields app will show a error message as it needs to fill all the fields. I have passParse the JSON response from the API to extract required weather information using https://openweathermap.org/current . I used API key from that Website to extract the weather information of my location. You can easily find the weather from the app.
